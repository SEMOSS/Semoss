# Welcome to SEMOSS

### What is SEMOSS?

SEMOSS stands for Semantic Open Source Software. It is a web application that allows users to build and deploy their custom solutions through a lightweight framework that provides connectors to databases, LLMs, vector stores, storage providers, and custom functions/APIs.

SEMOSS also provides a BI layer for exploring connections in data, creating tailored data products, and running custom algorithms. It can also be used as a data virtualization layer to merge data from multiple databases into a single frame and perform transformations in order to analyze their data.

SEMOSS started as a visualization and analytics tool for RDF data (semantic web) and has evolved over the years into a general purpose platform.
